## 🎨 My Pookalam

### Description
The design is circular in shape, symbolizing unity and harmony.

It features multiple colorful layers, arranged symmetrically with vibrant floral patterns.

The outermost layer is a bright yellow circle, resembling marigold petals, which gives a festive glow.

Inside, the design consists of repeated triangular petal-like motifs in shades of pink, orange, red, and green radiating outward.

Small white and yellow circles (dots) are placed at regular intervals, enhancing the rhythm of the design.

At the center, there are pink circular flower-like dots, forming the focal point.
